Pazaak is like Blackjack; each player is trying to hit a score of 20 without going over.

A game starts with a main deck of cards valued 1 to 10, and each player has their own hand of cards that can add or subtract a value.
On their turn, each player will draw a card from the deck and add that card's value to their score.
During their turn, a player may:
- End Turn to pass to the next player with no further action.
- Play a card from their hand to change their score, then pass to the next player.
- Stand to keep their current score until the round is over.

A player wins a round when they:
- Hit a score of 20 while the other player scores less than or more than 20.
- Gets closest to a score of 20 while the other player scores less than them or more than 20.
A player loses a round when they:
- End a turn with a score greater than 20.
- Stands with a lower score than the other player (if the other player doesn't 'bust').
